# Decal_Matching_InstaMat

This code was made for the InstaMat and Smudgr Pro addons to match decals to existing materials.

The included python file comes directly from the Smudgr Pro addon code, and should therefore be changed a little bit to get it working for yourself. For exampele the ShowMessageBox function is imported from another Smudgr Pro file and should be replaced for you to get it working.

I've added the comment #Specific to SMR for every part of the code that would probably need to be replaced

You can message me on BlenderMarket if you have questions

Current Bugs:
-When matching two different materials on one decal, the metallic and specular sliders will always change to the latest added material
